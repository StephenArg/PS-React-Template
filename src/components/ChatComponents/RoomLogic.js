// You can define room logic in here and import it where necessary. The logic for the rooms doesn't necessarily need
// to be a component either. That logic can be stored somewhere else as a standard js file. You can
// import the functions and variables as needed. If you want them to be set globally it would probably be best to
// put them in the global state manager. From there you'd connect (subscribe) the specific components that need that logic
